 //for the controls of the hud telling us which key to press, this needs to be retrieved from the actual settings in the game state to dynamically update when users set new controls.

//when it comes to detecting interactions, picking up an object that is able to be interacted with removes it from the scene visually, but how the raycaster is currently working, that object will still trigger the flow for a valid interacting object with no visible object remaining 
--i think this comes down to removing that interacted particle from the globeSystem.particles
